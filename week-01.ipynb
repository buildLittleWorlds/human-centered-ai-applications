Research consistently shows that children who eat school lunch perform better academically, have fewer behavioral issues, and miss fewer days of school. Despite these benefits, school lunch programs face persistent challenges: tight budgets force difficult tradeoffs between cost and nutrition, cultural preferences vary widely across communities, and logistical constraints make it hard to serve fresh food at scale. Recent policy changes have pushed for higher nutritional standards, but implementation remains uneven, with wealthier districts often finding it easier to comply than under-resourced ones.\n",
